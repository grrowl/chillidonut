<p>
  To validate a business idea, Terry needed a prototype that allowed users to
  route money between many sources and destinations completely intuitively,
  be rock-solid with an obvious and slick user experience, and
  parse existing bank transaction files (used by all banks today to transfer money).
  All on a start-up budget.

<p>
  The prototype was a resounding success and successfully proved the business as
  not just viable, but an obvious investment.
