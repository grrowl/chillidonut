repo for the next, incredibly-delayed version of my portfolio/site

## css slideshow notes:
```
4 slides @ 5 seconds each = 20s duration

base:  0s  --> in 0-1, out 5-6, nothing -20

0s  0%    0
1s  5%    1
5s  25%   1
6s  30%   0
20s 100%  0
```

If there's not enough slides, it'll "hang" on the first slide (which never fades)
