<!--

  Lets be honest, I'm a real person and you are too. This is the dry, papery version of me that will satisfy those who want to know the nuts and bolts of the past. I'd much rather talk about the potential of the future. If you would too, even if you're not interested in hiring me, lets have a coffee or a quick phone chat and see what comes up.

  Tom.

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>
    I am a young, enthusiastic web developer who has completed a Bachelor of Information Technology (Computer Science and Software Development). I have experience in developing web sites, am well versed in client- and server-side technologies and can develop across languages and platforms simultaneously and cohesively. I believe usability and accessibility are the most important aspects of interface design. I love developing for the web and crafting clever and effective solutions that are rock-solid and with a little personality to them where possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am always security-conscious in my development, have experience developing with proprietary and open-source frameworks and learn new languages and methodologies easily. I work well in teams, both face-to-face and virtually (via Skype, etc) and have great general knowledge about operating systems and working within them (primarily using Windows and deploying on Linux), as well as hardware troubleshooting and network protocols.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible and what's been done and would be ideal in either front- or back-end development position where I'm given flexibility to work on interesting and challenging campaigns. I shine working closely with designers to develop first-class front-ends using the latest HTML technologies, as well as building robust, object-oriented server-side applications while given the chance to grow in a fun and fast-paced team environment.
